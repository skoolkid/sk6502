The routine at <a href="../asm/217E.html">$217E</a> miscalculates the 10000s digit of a number. Instead of
repeatedly trying to subtract 10000 to determine the digit, it subtracts 10100
(and then checks whether the result is still 10100 or greater).

The numbers that MR WACKER asks the class to multiply are supposed to be

During dinner, the teacher on duty is supposed to walk up and down between the
table (at x-coordinate 54) and the middle of the bench (at x-coordinate 42) in
the dinner hall for a while before dinner actually starts. However, the x- and
y-coordinates of that second location are the wrong way round in command list
<a href="../asm/423B.html">$B8</a>, which means the teacher instead walks up and down between the
table in the dinner hall and the bottom of the staircase (at x-coordinate 17)
that leads up to the staff room.

<div class="paragraph">
BOY WONDER often takes a step back just before firing his catapult, which
results in his animation appearing somewhat jerky. Likewise, ANGELFACE also
often steps back just before throwing a punch, making his animation appear
somewhat jerky too.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this is that the continual subcommand routines that make BOY
WONDER fire occasionally (<a href="../asm/2CA5.html">$2CA5</a>) and ANGELFACE hit occasionally (<a href="../asm/270D.html">$270D</a>) do
not drop the return address from the stack after deciding to go ahead with the
fire/hit action. This means that they return to the middle of the
character-handling routine at <a href="../asm/3B5E.html">$3B5E</a>, which then has the opportunity of moving
them midstride before they begin the fire/hit action on the next pass through
that routine.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The jerky animation can be fixed by reversing the midstride check in the
routines at <a href="../asm/270D.html">$270D</a> and <a href="../asm/2CA5.html">$2CA5</a>:

<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">The bully and the blackboard</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If a teacher gives lines to ERIC for jumping, hitting or firing his catapult
while EINSTEIN is blaming either ERIC or BOY WONDER for writing on the
blackboard, the same teacher will then go on to give lines to ANGELFACE for
writing on the blackboard.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Why is the bully unfairly punished for this misdemeanour? It boils down to a
careless use of temporary variables in page 0. The routine at <a href="../asm/0A58.html">$0A58</a> stores
the character number of the boy that EINSTEIN will blame for writing on the
blackboard at <a href="../asm/00C0.html">$C0</a>, then makes EINSTEIN blame that boy, and finally picks up
the character number of the blamed boy from <a href="../asm/00C0.html">$C0</a> and passes it to the routine
at <a href="../asm/2552.html">$2552</a> to decide who should get lines.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Now, if the teacher spots ERIC jumping, hitting or firing while EINSTEIN is
blaming ERIC or BOY WONDER for writing on the blackboard, the routine at
<a href="../asm/191B.html">$191B</a> uses <a href="../asm/00C0.html">$C0</a> to temporarily store the character number of the teacher,
thus overwriting the character number of the boy EINSTEIN is telling tales on.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
All this means that by the time the routine at <a href="../asm/1DB7.html">$1DB7</a> is invoked to give
someone lines for writing on the blackboard, it defaults to giving ANGELFACE
lines because it doesn't recognise the teacher's character number at <a href="../asm/00C0.html">$C0</a> (see
the section of code at <a href="../asm/1DB7.html#1DFC">$1DFC</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To make the routine at <a href="../asm/191B.html">$191B</a> use <a href="../asm/00C3.html">$C3</a> instead of <a href="../asm/00C0.html">$C0</a> for storing the
teacher's character number:

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">The wall most stared at</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When a teacher is in the Map Room, he faces the wall instead of the class while
speaking. This is because command list <a href="../asm/4080.html">$80</a> sends the teacher up to the
map, but does not turn him round before starting the class.

<div><span id="aStepTooFar"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">A step too far</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If a teacher is going to teach a class in the Exam Room, he faces the wrong way
at the doorway when telling the kids to sit down.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this behaviour is that the x-coordinate of the top of the
staircase is defined, in the fifth entry of the table at <a href="../asm/4454.html">$4454</a>, as 76. This
means that when the teacher has reached the bottom of the staircase, his
x-coordinate is 69, which is one to the left of the x-coordinate of the Exam
Room doorway at 70, as defined in command list <a href="../asm/40AE.html">$84</a>. So after arriving
at x-coordinate 69, the teacher turns round and moves one step forward to reach
his destination.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
One possible fix for this is to make the teacher's destination x-coordinate 69
instead of 70:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
POKE 16564,69 <a href="../asm/40AE.html">($40B4,$45)</a>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Another possible (and perhaps better) fix is to define the x-coordinate of the
top of the staircase leading down to the Exam Room as 77 instead of 76. This
makes sense because 77 matches the x-coordinate used in the Spectrum version
and by the routine at <a href="../asm/34B5.html">$34B5</a> that moves ERIC one step down a staircase, and is
also 7 cells to the right of the bottom of the staircase, which is defined as
70 in the fourth entry of the table at <a href="../asm/4440.html">$4440</a> (7 cells being the height of the
staircase).

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Double staircases</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When a character is looking for ERIC, if he has to go down a staircase on the
left side of the skool, he will start at x-coordinate 12 instead of the usual
13, which makes him appear to be walking inside the staircase instead of on it.
Similarly, if the character looking for ERIC has to go down a staircase
on the right side of the skool, he will start at x-coordinate 77 instead of the
usual 76, which produces a similar effect.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason has more to do with the way characters other than ERIC are animated
when going down a staircase than it has to do with the x-coordinates of the
tops of the staircases themselves. When ERIC proceeds from one step to the
next, he moves midstride first, and then drops to the step below as he finishes
his stride. But the other characters - in contrast to ERIC and to their
counterparts in the ZX Spectrum version - move midstride as they drop to the
step below, and then finish their stride on that step before moving to the next
one. It's this drop-first-and-finish-the-stride-later technique that accounts
for the anomalous appearance.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Luckily, changing this technique to match ERIC's requires just a few POKEs that
modify the relevant section of code at <a href="../asm/0C3F.html#0D37">$0D37</a>:

In <a href="bugs.html#doubleStaircases">Double staircases</a> above we took the approach of modifying the
staircase descent technique of a character who is looking for ERIC in order to
fix an animation bug. But what if a character is not looking for ERIC? In that
case, it's the routine at <a href="../asm/13F3.html">$13F3</a> that takes care of any trip down a staircase.

<div class="box-title">Initial non-playtimes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Unlike the ZX Spectrum version, the C64 version of the game does not always
start on a playtime: two of the entries in the table of initial lesson numbers
at <a href="../asm/4650.html">$4650</a> are classroom periods.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
What's interesting is that the non-playtime lesson numbers in this table - $0C
and $3D - would be playtimes if the main timetable at <a href="../asm/5D00.html">$5D00</a> were exactly the
same as the one in the ZX Spectrum version. This strongly suggests that these

<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">Invisibility range</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a href="../asm/0BAC.html">$0BAC</a>, which is used to calculate the coordinate ranges within
which a character can be seen, does not always compute the minimum x-coordinate
correctly. The most obvious consequence of this miscalculation is that ERIC can
flagrantly violate the skool rules in front of a teacher, without getting
lines, when he's to the right of that teacher and in one of the following
locations:
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="">
<li>on the top floor with x-coordinate &lt; 47 (to the left of the blue shield in the Reading Room)</li>
<li>on the middle floor with x-coordinate &lt; 28 (to the left of the front seat in the White Room)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Specifically, in these situations ERIC's horizontal visibility range is
calculated as [x, x+10] (where 'x' is ERIC's x-coordinate) instead
of [x&#8722;10, x+10], which means any teacher to his left is effectively
unable to see him.

they are interpreted differently: each x-coordinate they contain is the maximum

If a pellet bounces off a teacher's head on the top floor of the skool, it will
disappear before it reaches the top of the screen. The reason for this is that
the routine at <a href="../asm/31EA.html">$31EA</a> (which updates the display) ignores the first ten bytes
of the screen refresh buffer at <a href="../asm/4008.html">$4008</a>, which correspond to the top two rows

them and thence to the shields, but been left wondering whether this method is
actually reliable, rest assured that in fact it most certainly is not.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason is that the routine at <a href="../asm/1640.html">$1640</a>, which checks whether ERIC is
standing on a boy, is rather careless with ERIC's x-coordinate. The routine
stores this x-coordinate at $D3, and then enters a loop to compare the value
stored there with the x-coordinate of each boy whose y-coordinate is one more
than ERIC's (i.e. underneath him). The problem is that the value at $D3 is
either decremented or incremented by one on each pass through the loop
depending on the boy's x-coordinate relative to ERIC's. So the comparison works
for the first boy checked, but is off by one for the next boy, then possibly
off by two for the next boy after that, and so on.

ERIC can be knocked out by BOY WONDER's catapult pellet even when he's sitting
on the floor or is already lying on the floor (and the pellet should really fly
straight over his head instead). The best way to reproduce this bug is to stand
(or sit) in BOY WONDER's line of fire in a classroom while everyone's waiting
for the teacher to show up for the lesson.

<div class="paragraph">
Before wiping the board and getting a lesson under way, ERIC's teacher will
wait for EINSTEIN to sit down first: see <a href="../asm/0B3B.html">$0B3B</a>. This makes sense at the
beginning of a lesson, but that same routine is called several times during the
course of a lesson (see <a href="../asm/0A58.html">$0A58</a>) to check whether ERIC is present, which means
that the teacher will also stop whatever he's doing and wait for EINSTEIN to
sit down before continuing on those occasions too. This is not really
noticeable except during lessons where there is no question-and-answer session
taking place between the teacher and the swot, and the teacher is pacing up and
down in front of the blackboard instead. During those lessons, the call to
<a href="../asm/0B3B.html">$0B3B</a> is made each time the teacher has reached the point where he is just
about to turn round; if EINSTEIN is not sitting in a chair at that time
(because ERIC has pushed him out of his seat, for example), the teacher will
wait until EINSTEIN is back in his seat before turning round.

If ERIC has exactly 10000 lines, MR WACKER will come rushing to ERIC's side and
say "YOU HAVE OVER 10000 LINES TO WRITE ERIC...". Does the headmaster not know
how to count, or does he actually think that 10000 > 10000? Either way, this is
poor form for a maths teacher.

WONDER for writing on the board, MR WACKER will still give lines to the absent

BOY WONDER to hear the admonition.) The same thing may also happen in lesson
<a href="../lessons/ED.html">$ED</a> (MR WITHIT - WHITE ROOM), when BOY WONDER is once again in
the Revision Library (this time accompanied by ANGELFACE).
