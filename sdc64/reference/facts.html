Little boy no. 5's <a href="../asm/4A00.html">initial x-coordinate</a> is set to 128 (out of sight),

<div class="box-title">Unsynchronised shields</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Shields that have been hit by ERIC don't necessarily flash in sync (as they do
by virtue of hardware design in the ZX Spectrum version): some may be displayed
with inverted colours when others are not. This is because the interrupt
routine at <a href="../asm/39C7.html">$39C7</a> that makes the shields flash will swap a shield's foreground
and background colours when a shield is hit, regardless of the current colour
status of any other shields.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Between the lines amounts</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The number of lines a teacher gives is always a multiple of 50 from 150 to 900
(see the section of code at <a href="../asm/1DB7.html#1DE9">$1DE9</a>). In the ZX Spectrum version, it's always a
multiple of 100 from 100 to 800.

<div class="box-title">A quick message</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The <a href="../asm/4620.html">PRESS 'U' IF YOU UNDERSTAND</a> message doesn't have 8 spaces at the
end like other spoken messages, and so ends very abruptly. It's also different
from the corresponding message in the ZX Spectrum version: <a href="https://skoolkid.github.io/skooldaze/asm/ECE0.html">Press 'U'
if you understood</a>.

<div><span id="linesMessageVSpeechBubble"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Lines message v. speech bubble</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When a teacher is giving lines, the speech bubble disappears. The speech bubble
reappears after the lines message box has been removed. This happens because
both the lines message box and the speech bubble are drawn by using sprites,
and there are not enough sprites to draw both simultaneously.

<div class="box-title">Strident scrawling</div>

When ERIC writes on a blackboard, the letters always appear in upper case. This
is unlike the ZX Spectrum version, where ERIC can write in lower case as well.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">One stampede out of two</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Playtime period <a href="../lessons/FC.html">$FC</a>, in which the little boys run around the
skool knocking people over, does not appear anywhere in the <a href="../asm/5D00.html">main
timetable</a>. Its companion stampede playtime, <a href="../lessons/FD.html">$FD</a>, does appear
once, however.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the ZX Spectrum version, there are three stampede playtimes in the main
timetable: one instance of $FD, and two instances of $FC.

<div><span id="angelfacesXrayVision"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">ANGELFACE's X-ray vision</div>
<div class="paragraph">
When ANGELFACE is in the White Room waiting for the teacher to arrive and ERIC
is in the Exam Room next to and facing the wall, ANGELFACE will throw punches
at the White Room wall, apparently aware that ERIC is behind it, but unaware
that ERIC cannot walk through the wall and meet his fist.

<tr>
<td class="" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><img alt="axrv" src="../images/udgs/axrv.png" /></td>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason this happens is that the routine at <a href="../asm/27D2.html">$27D2</a>, which checks whether
anyone is within punching range, does not take into account the walls between
classrooms.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
However, ANGELFACE will only perform this trick in the White Room: in the other
classrooms he doesn't get close enough to the wall to be able to 'see' anyone
through it.

What's interesting is that the messages in the C64 version don't even fit on
the blackboard, which suggests that they were fixed for the ZX Spectrum
version. But the ZX Spectrum version was released <em>before</em> the C64
version. What goes on?

<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">The special playtime truce</div>
<div class="paragraph">
BOY WONDER doesn't spend every period looking for opportunities to fire his
catapult: in special playtimes <a href="../lessons/F3.html">$F3</a> (in which ANGELFACE has
mumps) and <a href="../lessons/F4.html">$F4</a> (in which EINSTEIN is going tell MR WACKER what
ERIC's up to) he keeps his catapult in his pocket at all times.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Similarly, ANGELFACE doesn't spend every period looking for opportunities to
beat up his classmates: in special playtimes <a href="../lessons/F3.html">$F3</a> (in which he
has mumps), <a href="../lessons/F4.html">$F4</a> (in which EINSTEIN is going to tell MR WACKER
what ERIC's up to) and <a href="../lessons/F5.html">$F5</a> (in which BOY WONDER has hidden a
pea-shooter) he keeps his fists to himself.

<div><span id="theAccessibleBackSeat"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">The accessible back seat</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Unlike the ZX Spectrum version, in the C64 version kids (besides ERIC) can sit
in the back seat in the Reading Room.

</div>
<div><span id="boy11"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">The importance of little boy no. 11</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In demo mode, ERIC bases his every move on where little boy no. 11 is and what
he's doing (see the main loop at <a href="../asm/0800.html">$0800</a>). This important role means that
little boy no. 11 is in all of ERIC's classes (if he weren't, ERIC would be
guilty of truancy in demo mode). In fact, little boy no. 11 is the only
character besides EINSTEIN who joins ERIC for every class.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="skoolTunes"></span></div>
<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Skool tunes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The tune that plays just before a game (or demo mode) starts, and also when
ERIC goes up a year, is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_and_Boys_Come_Out_To_Play">Girls
and Boys Come Out To Play</a>. The tune that plays when ERIC makes the final
shield flash, and when he opens the safe, is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au_clair_de_la_lune">Au clair de la
lune</a>.
</div>
</div>
<div><span id="onePaceOrThree"></span></div>
<div class="box box-1">
<div class="box-title">One pace or three?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If a teacher is conducting a class without ERIC, or is conducting ERIC's class
but has chosen not to engage in a question-and-answer session with EINSTEIN, he
will pace up and down in front of the blackboard (or map). But the number of
paces up and then down depends on the room he's in.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If he's in the White Room, he will take one pace up and then down, oscillating
between x-coordinates 29 and 30. If he's in the Reading Room, he will also take
one pace up and then down, oscillating between x-coordinates 45 and 46. And if
he's in the Map Room, he will once again take one pace up and then down,
oscillating between x-coordinates 61 and 62. But if he's in the Exam Room, he
will take three paces up and then down, oscillating between x-coordinates 44
and 47.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The reason for this discrepancy in pace numbers is the method used to calculate
the teacher's next pace-up or pace-down destination, which is to take his
current x-coordinate and do an EOR $03 on it: see the sections of code at
<a href="../asm/09E9.html#0A47">$0A47</a> and <a href="../asm/0A58.html#0B0C">$0B0C</a>.

MR WACKER's back foot better than tiles $0D and $8D do) make their way into
page $A9? The most likely answer is lack of space: there are no unused sprite
tiles based in page $A9, and tiles $0D and $8D are similar enough to tiles $51
and $D1 to make reasonable substitutes.

ANGELFACE is unique among the cast of characters in that if ERIC knocks him

<div class="box-title">BOY WONDER shoots, ERIC scores</div>
<div class="paragraph">
BOY WONDER may be a tearaway, but sometimes his impulsive nature can be more of
a help than a hindrance. If he lets rip with his catapult and the pellet knocks
EINSTEIN for six, you score 30 points - just as if ERIC had floored the swot
himself. The reason for this is that the routine at <a href="../asm/0FBA.html">$0FBA</a> does not bother to
check whose pellet has collided with EINSTEIN's head.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
It's also possible for one of BOY WONDER's pellets to bounce off a teacher's
head, hit a shield, and make it flash - scoring even more points - but that
would be a rare occurrence indeed.

<div class="box box-2">
<div class="box-title">Seat selection</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Typically, when a teacher arrives at the classroom doorway to start the lesson,
the boys will rush to the back seat and sit down. However, if a boy is late for
class in the Map Room or Exam Room - that is, he arrives at the doorway after
the teacher already has - then he will take some other seat (as shown below),
depending on where his command list sends him.

<div class="paragraph">
The reason this happens to a latecomer is that he doesn't get a chance to walk
around before having to find a seat and sit down, because the teacher has
already arrived, the corresponding signal has already been raised, and so the
routine at <a href="../asm/1A04.html">$1A04</a> moves straight to the next command in the command list:
<a href="../asm/1D16.html">$1D16</a> (find a seat and sit down). That command makes the boy move forward to
the next seat if he's facing left (which is the case if he's just entered the
Map Room or Exam Room), or walk to the back of the classroom if he's facing
right. When the boy does get a chance to walk around first, he ends up facing
right before that command kicks in, and then keeps moving right to the back of
the class.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Note that BOY WONDER always tries to sit in the back seat in the Exam Room,
because after entering that room he goes to the blackboard first, and then
walks to the middle of the room, at which point he is facing right.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
This unusual seat selection does not happen in the Reading Room or White Room,
because the boy is facing right when he arrives in the classroom, and so keeps
moving right to the back of the class.

There are 64 periods in the <a href="../asm/5D00.html">main timetable</a>: 24 playtimes, 4 dinner
periods, and 36 lesson periods (when ERIC is supposed to be in either a
classroom or the Revision Library).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the 36 lesson periods, ERIC is scheduled to be in the White Room 12 times,
the Reading Room 10 times, the Map Room 6 times, the Exam Room 3 times, and the
Revision Library 5 times.

<div class="paragraph">
ERIC has 9 classes with MR CREAK, 8 classes with MR ROCKITT, and 7 classes each
with MR WACKER and MR WITHIT.

<div class="paragraph">
ERIC has 6 classes with MR CREAK in the Reading Room (which is more than any
other teacher/classroom combination), but only one class with MR WACKER in the
White Room and only one class with MR ROCKITT in the Exam Room.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR WACKER is on dinner duty for two of the dinner periods, and MR WITHIT is on
duty for the other two.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR ROCKITT is the busiest teacher, teaching a class in 34 of the 36 lesson
periods. MR WACKER is the laziest teacher, teaching a class in only 26 periods.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
MR WACKER teaches most often in the Exam Room (12 times); MR ROCKITT also
teaches most often in the Exam Room (15 times); MR WITHIT teaches most often in
the Map Room (22 times); and MR CREAK teaches most often in the Reading Room
(19 times).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Every boy is taught at least 3 times by each teacher, and at least 3 times in
each classroom. However, little boys 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are - unlike all
the other boys - never in the Revision Library during a lesson period.

ANGELFACE spends more lesson periods in the Revision Library than any other boy

During playtime, the teacher most likely to be found pacing up and down in the
staff room is MR CREAK, who spends 23 of the 24 playtimes in the <a href="../asm/5D00.html">main
timetable</a> in that room (the one exception being the playtime where the little
boys stampede around the skool). The teacher least likely to be found in the
staff room is MR WACKER, who spends only two playtimes there; the other 22
playtimes he divides between his study (4 times) and walking around the skool
(18).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
BOY WONDER spends most of his playtimes (15 out of 24) in search of clean
blackboards to write on.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
ANGELFACE and EINSTEIN spend every playtime wandering around the skool from one
<a href="../asm/105B.html">randomly chosen location</a> to another. The 11 little boys, however,
split their playtimes between wandering around the skool and walking up and
down in one of the four playtime locations (Revision Library, fire escape, gym
and big window) until the bell rings.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The playtime probabilities described here are all subject to alteration by the
fact that, three times out of eight, a playtime in the main timetable is
replaced with a 'special' playtime (<a href="../lessons/F3.html">$F4</a>, <a href="../lessons/F4.html">$F4</a> or
<a href="../lessons/F5.html">$F5</a>) chosen at random (see <a href="../asm/3B46.html">$3B46</a>).

Understandably, ERIC is always eager for playtime to come, but the number of

Special playtimes - the ones where ERIC must avoid contact with ANGELFACE,
